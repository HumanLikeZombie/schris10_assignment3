# schris10_assignment3
Assignment 3, homework 3 for UNIX CS 2080.
This is where my assignment three deliverables will go, including the bash scripting file.

# Amendments 1 and 2
I made a mistake and added my already started version of the code so I redownloaded the file and added it here to show version control and progress when I am building the code.

# Assignment done!
All done with the assignment. I got this to run perfectly in my Ubuntu WSL. It should be all good to run the script or copy and paste it.
